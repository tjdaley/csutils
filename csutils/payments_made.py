    """
    Takes tab-separated values from the OAG web site and converts to a list of dicts.
    
    The AG web site provides payment information in an HTML table. When that is swiped
    by the user and pasted into a text box, it appears as tab-separated values. This
    function converts the TSVs into a list of dicts where there is one list entry per
    payment made and each *payment* dict has at least the following keys:
        'payment_date' (datetime): Date payment was made.
        'payment_amount' (Decimal): Amount of payment.
        'unapplied_amount' (Decimal): Amount of paymente that has not been applied to
            a payment that is due. This starts as the same value as *payment_amount*
            and then the consuming application decrements this to zero as the payment
            is applied to outstanding balances.
    
    Args:
        tsv (str): Tab-separated values from AG web site
        filename (str): Filename to use instead of *tsv*, for testing.
    
    Returns:
        (list[dict]): List of payment dicts, described above
    
    Throws:
        AttributeError - If *tsv* is not of type *str*.
        IndexError - If the *tsv* data contains a row without enough values, i.e. is missing a column
        ValueError - If the payment amount or date are not parseable.
    
    Side Effects:
        None.
    
    Sample Use:
        from csutils import payments_made
        tsv = '01/01/2021\t387.50\txxxxxxx\n02/01/2020\t387.50\txxxxxxx'
