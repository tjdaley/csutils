                                half of the full monthly amount. If weekly, then this is the weekly

        description (str): A descriptive string returned in payment list.
        fixed_payment (bool): If True, every payment on the list will be equal to *initial_amount*. This
                              is used for insurance reimbursement schedules where the amount reimbursed
